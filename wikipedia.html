                <hr>
                <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as
                    few implementation dependencies as possible.
                    It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere
                    (WORA),[17]
                    meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to
                    recompile.[18]
                    Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
                    regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
                    The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
                    The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification)
                    that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.
                    As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to
                    GitHub,[citation not found][19][20] particularly for clientâ€“server web applications,
                    with a reported 9 million developers

                <b>History</b>
                <hr>
                <p>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June
                    1991.[22] Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the
                    digital cable television industry at the time.[23] The language was initially called Oak after an
                    oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was
                    finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type of coffee from Indonesia.[24] Gosling designed Java
                    with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar
